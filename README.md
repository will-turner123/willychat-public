# Introducing WillyChat
![WillyChat](https://github.com/will-turner123/willychat-public/blob/master/src/theme/images/hero.png?raw=true)

WillyChat is an instant messaging platform similar to Slack or Discord, built with React on the frontend and Firebase on the backend. 
You can view a live demo at:  https://willychat.herokuapp.com 
(Note that it may take a second for the app to turn back on!)

## Features
### Servers
Users can both join and create chat servers. These servers are divided into text channels, which users can send both images and messages to. Server owners can set server members to be moderators, allowing them to kick and ban other users. 

### Friends and private messages
Users can add each other as friends and start private chats with each other. Users will be notified about messages through the notification system. Users also have the ability to block other users as well, hiding their messages in public servers.

### Fully Responsive

WillyChat works flawlessly on all screen sizes.
